    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        I am a Computer Science undergraduate with a strong focus on Machine Learning and Data Science,
        driven by an interest in building reliable and interpretable data-driven systems.
        I enjoy working across the complete machine learning lifecycle — from exploratory data analysis
        and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and iterative improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
        My projects emphasize clean, reproducible code and thoughtful evaluation using metrics beyond
        accuracy, especially in scenarios involving class imbalance and real-world decision trade-offs.
        I actively incorporate feedback and iterate on my work to improve both model performance
        and engineering quality.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, I am expanding my expertise toward Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning,
        with a growing interest in Transformer-based architectures and representation learning.
        My goal is to apply these techniques to practical problems while maintaining a strong foundation
        in machine learning fundamentals.

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Titanic Survival Prediction</h3>
      <p>
        Built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset.
        Conducted detailed exploratory data analysis to uncover key survival patterns and performed
        comprehensive data preprocessing including missing value imputation and feature encoding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE and trained a Logistic Regression model with hyperparameter
        tuning via GridSearchCV. Optimized model performance using ROC-AUC, Precision–Recall analysis,
        and k-fold cross-validation, achieving approximately 80% accuracy and strong minority class recall.

    <h2>Currently Learning</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently deepening my understanding of Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning,
      with a focus on modern architectures such as Transformers. My learning is centered around
      practical implementation, model evaluation, and understanding how these approaches scale to
      real-world problems.
