    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        I am a Computer Science undergraduate with a strong focus on Machine Learning and Data Science,
        driven by an interest in building reliable and interpretable data-driven systems.
        I enjoy working across the complete machine learning lifecycle — from exploratory data analysis
        and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and iterative improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
        My projects emphasize clean, reproducible code and thoughtful evaluation using metrics beyond
        accuracy, especially in scenarios involving class imbalance and real-world decision trade-offs.
        I actively incorporate feedback and iterate on my work to improve both model performance
        and engineering quality.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, I am expanding my expertise toward Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning,
        with a growing interest in Transformer-based architectures and representation learning.
        My goal is to apply these techniques to practical problems while maintaining a strong foundation
        in machine learning fundamentals.

    <div class="project">
        <h3>Titanic Survival Prediction</h3>

        <p>
            Designed and implemented an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict passenger survival,
            with emphasis on data understanding, evaluation robustness, and handling real-world constraints
            such as class imbalance.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Performed detailed EDA to identify key survival drivers</li>
            <li>Handled class imbalance using SMOTE</li>
            <li>Optimized Logistic Regression using GridSearchCV</li>
            <li>Evaluated using ROC-AUC, Precision–Recall curves, and k-fold cross-validation</li>
            <li>Achieved ~80% accuracy and ~0.85 mean ROC-AUC</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Currently Learning</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently deepening my understanding of Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning,
      with a focus on modern architectures such as Transformers. My learning is centered around
      practical implementation, model evaluation, and understanding how these approaches scale to
      real-world problems.
